# 📊 Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) with PyMC

> **Keywords**: Marketing Mix Modeling, MMM, Bayesian Modeling, PyMC, Budget Optimization, Python, Machine Learning, Media Attribution

---

## 📌 Overview
A **data-driven Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)** project leveraging **Bayesian inference (PyMC)** to optimize media spend and improve ROI.

The objective is to check the effectiveness of PyMC for MMM with it's standard settings on MMM API. However PyMC MMM allows for more flexibility in terms of selecting priors for our model, ucing custom Adstock and Saturation functions, and more.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive framework for building, validating, and optimizing MMM models using PyMC, with a focus on practical applications in marketing analytics.

## 🚀 Features
- **Bayesian MMM** using PyMC
- **Prior & Posterior analysis** for model validation
- **Post predictive ROAS** evaluation for each channel
- **Budget allocation optimization**
- **Handling different budget scenarios** analysis
- **Budget optimization with constraints** (Min and Max allocation per channel)
